# Name, Country, and Gender Analysis
Taking lists of names, country, and gender from various sources, then doing data analysis on them.

So far I've done an analysis on the 2018 Chicago Marathon and created some plotly maps to visualize it. Here's the corresponding Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/NickVance/Name-Country-and-Gender-Analysis/blob/master/Chicago%20Marathon%202018%20-%20Name%2C%20Country%2C%20and%20Gender%20Analysis.ipynb

Once the data is in the right format, the code can be used to run a similar analysis and create similar maps very quickly. Feel free to do so, but please link back to this page if you do.
